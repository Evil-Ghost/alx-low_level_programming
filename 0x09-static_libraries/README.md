[Task 0]: ./libmy.a
[Task 1]: ./create_static_lib.sh
[Header file]: ./main.h

## Mandatory tasks

### Task 0

Create the static library `libmy.a` containing all the functions listed

**Task file:** [libmy.a][Task 0]

### Task 1

Create a script called `create_static_lib.sh` that creates a static library called `liball.a` from all the `.c` files that are in the current directory.

**Task file:** [create\_static\_lib.sh][Task 1]

## My process

### Built with

- Shell
- C

### What I learned

I learnt what libraries are in C and how to create a static library also how to use a static though not demonstrated in this project. I still gained an insight on what dynamic/shared libraries are. Didn't get to successfully create one but understood what it is all about.
