## Mandatory tasks

### Task 0

Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

- If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
- You should not remove the path before the name of the program

**Task file:** [0-whatsmyname.c][Task 0]

### Task 1

Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

- Your program should print a number, followed by a new line

**Task file:** [1-args.c][Task 1]

### Task 2

Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.

- All arguments should be printed, including the first one
- Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line

**Task file:** [2-args.c][Task 2]

### Task 3

Write a program that multiplies two numbers.

- Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
- You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
- If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print `Error`, followed by a new line, and return `1`

**Task file:** [3-mul.c][Task 3]

### Task 4

Write a program that adds positive numbers.

- Print the result, followed by a new line
- If no number is passed to the program, print `0`, followed by a new line
- If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and return `1`
- You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an `int`

**Task file:** [4-add.c][Task 4]

## Advanced tasks

### Task 5


## My process

### Built with

- C


### What I learned

I learnt about passing arguments to a main function which I always wondered if it was possible. This project was able to confirm all my doubts and I realised that programming is very verstile owing to the fact that it has been customised over the years it existed so it's possible that almost all posibilities have been addressed.
